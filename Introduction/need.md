## Why Do We Require Ansible:
- Ansible automates and simplifies repetitive complex, and tedious operations.
- Ansible is open source, saves time as well as human efforts & is easy to implement.
- Ansible architecture is simple and effective, It works by connecting to your nodes & pushing small programs to them.
- Ansible is push-based architecture & doesn't need any agents running on the client nodes.
- Ansible works over SSH and doesn't require any daemons, special servers, or libraries to work. A text editor and a command line tool are usually enough to get your work done.
