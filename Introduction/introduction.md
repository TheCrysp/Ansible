# Ansible Introduction

![Ansilbe](ansible.png)

Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intraservice orchestration, and provisioning. 

Automation is crucial these days, with IT environments that are too complex and often need to scale too quickly for system administrators and developers to keep up if they had to do everything manually. Automation simplifies complex tasks, not just making developers’ jobs more manageable but allowing them to focus attention on other tasks that add value to an organization. 

In other words, it frees up time and increases efficiency. And Ansible, as noted above, is rapidly rising to the top in the world of automation tools. Let’s look at some of the reasons for Ansible’s popularity.

Ansible doesn't depend on agent software and has no additional security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy.

Ansible uses playbook to describe automation jobs, and playbook uses very simple language i.e. YAML

Ansible uses the hosts file where one can group the hosts and can control the actions on a specific group in the playbooks.
